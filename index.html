        <h1>Music -The Art Which Reflects Life</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2><i>What is Importance of Music in Life?</i></h2>
        <p>The music tastes,genres may differ according to age,living or moods. But we can not deny that everyone
            cherishes
            it.It impacts every stage of our life.
        </p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li><b>Music makes working pleasant!</b></li>
            <p>Everything that we do in our lives is in rhythm.Music is not seperate from our lives.We listen,we learn
                to play,we dance to it.Music is
                everywhere..atparties, homes, seashores, rides.We learn songs more easily than our text books.Most of us
                enjoy it and learn it. Even while doing the boring chores,
                playing your favourite songs on repeat gives you extra strength to complete it.
            </p>
            <li><b>Music gives horizons to think beyond!</b></li>
            <p>As for many people that I have seen and I get motivation from,are musicians. The more I think about it, I
                come to conclusion that the passion and diligence and emotions with which they deliver the music and it
                turns to the magic to
                people.We can observe a whole new and different kind of world in music.</p>
            <li><b>It makes you relax and take your time!</b></li>
            <p>Music is that makes you calm.From our running tasks and routine, music is the way to escape from the
                things for little time and enjoy some beats or rhythms.Even if you are stuck somewhere, take your time
                and after listening or playing of some piano keys or your favourite song, you might get some ideas on
                how to proceed.It does heal.</p>
            <li><b>It increases creativity!</b></li>
            <p>The more you try, the more you get out of you.It's proven that it develops the
                abilities that we have. Listening to different
                kinds of music
                makes you realize and value the creative work behind the music.</p>
            <li><b>It's a good way to express your emotions!</b></li>
            <p>The Music we listen to or play conveys your feelings. Not that if someone is listening to sad and sober
                songs
                mean that they are broken all the time because some really love to listen to them.May be there is
                musical melancholy they want to enjoy. Music do reflects
                your thoughts,frequency without any word.It pieces together our words without actually saying it.
            </p>
            <li><b>Gives you more power!</b></li>
            <p>Music has power to change the world, to change the way someone thinks and brings people
                closer.It inspires you to come out of your comfort zone and try new things.</p>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>The more you explore and dive in music, you are about to discover beautiful,heart touching rhythms of nature.
            You are going to find positivity and inspirations from the people who are already the masters of their work.
            Wish you well in your journey of discovering good rhythms of life :)
